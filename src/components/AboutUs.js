            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>The origins of Trippy drawings go all the way back to the 1940s when Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann discovered lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Hofmann was researching derivates from lysergic acid to create a circulatory and respiratory stimulant that had no negative side effects on the uterus. The result? LSD. Once he created the drug, he started experimenting with it and soon discovered its psychedelic effects.</p>
